            <h1>Rishikesh Mandir</h1>
            <p>
                Rishikesh is a city in India’s northern state of Uttarakhand, in the Himalayan 
                foothills beside the Ganges River. The river is considered holy, and 
                the city is renowned as a center for studying yoga and meditation. Temples and ashrams 
                (centers for spiritual studies) line the eastern bank around Swarg Ashram, 
                a traffic-free, alcohol-free and vegetarian enclave upstream from Rishikesh town.

            <h1>Goa</h1>
            <p>
                Goa is a state in western India with coastlines stretching along the 
                Arabian Sea. Its long history as a Portuguese colony prior to 1961 is 
                evident in its preserved 17th-century churches and the area’s tropical 
                spice plantations. Goa is also known for its beaches, ranging from popular 
                stretches at Baga and Palolem to those in laid-back fishing villages such as Agonda.

            <p>
                Auli is a Himalayan ski resort and hill station in the north Indian 
                state of Uttarakhand. It’s surrounded by coniferous and oak forests,

                Auli to the town of Joshimath. North of Auli are the colorful 
                Badrinath Temple, a Hindu pilgrimage site, and the Valley of Flowers 
                National Park, with its alpine flora and wildlife like snow leopards 
                and red foxes.
